# 👋 Welcome to My Notes

This site is a personal collection of technical notes, summaries, and references I've gathered throughout my journey as a software engineer.

## 🧠 What You'll Find

- 📚 Summaries on backend, frontend, and devops topics.
- 🐍 Notes on Python, Java, JavaScript, and more.
- 💼 Interview preparation material.
- 🔐 Best practices, security, and system architecture.
- ⚙️ Automation, Docker, and databases.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I needed a simple and accessible way to organize my technical notes — and what better tool than [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)? Sharing what I learn helps me reinforce my knowledge, and I hope it can help others too.

## 🚀 How to Use This Site

Use the sidebar to browse topics. Each section is structured for quick reading and clarity.
