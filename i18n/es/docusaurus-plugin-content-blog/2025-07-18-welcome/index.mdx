# 👋 Welcome to My Blog

Hey there! I'm **Jimmy Tzuc**, a software engineer from Yucatán, México.

This blog is my corner of the web where I share:

- 🛠 Insights from real-world software engineering
- 🧪 Lessons learned from projects and experiments
- 📌 Quick technical tips and code snippets
- 🧠 Reflections on continuous learning and personal growth
- 💬 Thoughts about developer life and career

{/* truncate */}

## Why a Blog?

Over the past years, I've realized that **writing helps me think clearer**, retain what I learn, and connect with other devs. Some things are too valuable to just keep in our heads or lost in bookmarks.

So here we are — building a space to **document, reflect, and share**.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a student, or just curious, I hope you find something useful or relatable here.


## 🌐 Language Notice

Some articles will be written in **Spanish**, as it's my native language and helps me express certain ideas more naturally.

Whenever that’s the case, I’ll include a clear notice at the top of the post. I believe language shouldn't be a barrier to sharing knowledge.

## 🔍 Topics I’ll Cover

- My Culture
- Backend & DevOps deep dives  
- Notes on Python, Java, JavaScript  
- System design reflections  
- Career advice and learning tactics  
- Personal projects & experiments
